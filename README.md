Tic Tac Toe game; currently has 2-player mode and human vs computer mode; my goal is to add a more easier-to-beat computer player
It supports minimax algorithm for the computer opponent. Its a type of uninformed search that:

explores all possible future game states (levels in trees)
assigns scores to end states (+1 for computer win, -1 for human win, 0 for draw)
works backward to choose moves that maximize the computer's minimum guaranteed score
